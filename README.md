Randomly generate fantasy character with random stats, attributes and background.

This simple fantasy character generator was made with JavaScript. 

<strong>Roll The Dice</strong>

I've generated the skill numbers for each by rolling four 6 sided die and taking the best value, of the four dice. 

<strong>Who Are You?</strong>

My code knows if you've been assigned as a male or female. It assigns your first name to reflect your gender. Last names are shared by both genders. 

<strong>Culture</strong>

The also knows what race you are and assigns the appropriate homeland and name to you (it'd be weird if you were a human named Robert Redford from the Misty Mountains).
