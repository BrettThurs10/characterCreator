# characterCreator
Randomly generate fantasy character with random stats, attributes and background.

This simple fantasy character generator was made with JavaScript. 

Roll The Dice
I've generated the skill numbers for each by rolling four 6 sided die and taking the best value, of the four dice. 

Who Are You?
My code knows if you've been assigned as a male or female. It assigns your first name to reflect your gender. Last names are shared by both genders. 

Culture
The also knows what race you are and assigns the appropriate homeland and name to you (it'd be weird if you were a human named Robert Redford from the Misty Mountains).
